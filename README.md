# 🏠 House Price Prediction & Clustering (GUI)

[WIP] This project explores **house price prediction** by combining **deep learning (autoencoders)**, **regression**, and **unsupervised clustering**. All with a dedicated GUI.  

**Predict residential property values using deep learning with an interactive visualization dashboard**

## 📌 Features

- **ML-Powered Prediction**  
  Neural network model trained on housing features (square footage, quality ratings, etc.)

- **Interactive Dashboard (GUI)**  
  Visualize key metrics:  
  - 📈 Training loss curve  
  - 🌳 Feature clustering dendrogram *(via GMM)*  
  - 🔄 Actual vs Predicted prices  
  - 📉 Prediction residuals  

- **Unsupervised Clustering with GMM**  
  Houses are grouped using **Gaussian Mixture Models** to identify clusters of similar properties.
  
- **Deep Learning Regressor**  
  A fully-connected neural network is trained to predict house prices using numerical and categorical features.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  - ▶️ Input panel with many property features  
  - 🎯 Real-time price prediction button  
  - 🛖 A list of prices for similar houses within the same cluster is displayed to the user for comparison
