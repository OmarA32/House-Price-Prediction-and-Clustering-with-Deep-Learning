# House Price Prediction with Clustering and Autoencoders

[WIP] This project explores **house price prediction** by combining **deep learning (autoencoders)**, **regression**, and **unsupervised clustering**. 

---
  
## 🔍 Features

- 💡 **Autoencoder**: Compresses high-dimensional input data into meaningful latent representations.
- 📈 **Regressor**: Predicts house prices using a neural network with PyTorch.
- 🧠 **Clustering**: Uses KMeans on the encoded data to group similar houses.
- 📊 **Loss Visualization**: Track and plot training loss over time.
- 🏷️ **Sample Inspection**: Compare actual vs predicted prices and see which cluster a house belongs to.


Used Dataset: Ames Housing Dataset (Kaggle)
